Thinking back to how life has changed since the 90s, we've seen a shift in what's important. Back then, being strong was a big deal. Then came the 2000s, focusing on education. Now, it's all about technology.

But with each change, technology has been taking over. Machines do what used to require physical strength, and the internet has made memorizing things less important.

Yet, one thing hasn't changed: our ability to think and plan. However, as AI gets smarter, we wonder what will matter most for success in the future.

Will it be strength, memory, and planning, or is there something more to being human?

With AI potentially replacing jobs, we're questioning our worth. What will guide us in this new world?

Take programming, for example. If AI had started coding in the 2000s, would we have new frameworks like React or Vue?

The answer lies in our unique ability to create. Unlike AI, which improves existing ideas, humans invent new ones.

So, while AI can help us, it can't replace our creativity. It's here to assist, not take over.

As we navigate this AI-driven world, let's celebrate our creativity and redefine what it means to be human.
