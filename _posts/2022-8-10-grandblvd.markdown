Grand boulevard is a new city in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq. The client needs a databse system to manage sales, payments and installments.

The system should be scalable to include more features in the future.

We choosed Odoo as a framework and developed the system using community version on our own hosting.
The system is fully modular and we followd Odoo standard development guidelines.
