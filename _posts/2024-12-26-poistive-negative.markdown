All actions comes from two main sources, `fear` or `pleasure`.
When you are doing something, you are either doing it because you are afraid of the consequences of not doing it, or you are doing it because you are looking for the pleasure that comes from doing it.
This simple concept can be applied to every aspect of your life, from your work to your relationships to your health.

When you are working on a project, are you doing it because you are afraid of what will happen if you don't finish it, or are you doing it because you enjoy the process and the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing it?

When you are in a relationship, are you staying in it because you are afraid of being alone, or are you staying in it because you enjoy the companionship and the love that you receive from your partner?

When you are taking care of your health, are you exercising and eating well because you are afraid of getting sick, or are you doing it because you enjoy feeling strong and healthy?

Let's focus on the work aspect of this concept.
As an employer or a manager, its up to you which source you want to use to motivate your employees.
The fear source is the easiest way to motivate your employees, However it will generate a negative energy, and it will make your employees less creative and less productive.

You will end up with a team of employees who are just doing their job because they are afraid of losing it, not because they love it.
with a team of employees who has no other choice but to stay in your company, not because they want to.
And obviously, with a team of employees who are not happy, and they will not make your customers happy.

Unfortunately, for the managers its not a matter of days to switch and build a pleasure source for their employees.
Its not something you can learn from books or podcasts.
Instead its a matter of effort and time you've spent on yourself to know your ego, who are you and what you want from your life.
Most of us are lying to ourselves, we are not honest with ourselves, we are not doing what we love, we are not living the life we want. 

To gain such a pure and honest vision, you should be able to see and listen.

When your mind is full of experiences, thoughts, fear, anger, ego and pride, you CANNOT see and listen.


You can only see and listen when you are empty, when you are calm, when you are humble.
I finish this post with a quote from the great Rumi:
 
 این محبت هم نتیجهٔ دانشست -  کی گزافه بر چنین تختی نشست

 از حریصی عاقبت نادیدنست - بر دل و بر عقل خود خندیدنست
