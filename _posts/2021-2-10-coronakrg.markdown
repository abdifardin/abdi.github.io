Ad the begning of the covid outbreaks, we received a project from Sulaymaniyah health orginzation to build an online database system to manage the covid tests.
We immediately started building the system and within a month we could deliver it to the client.
It was a user frinedly, fully custom, react backed database system which let the goverment staff add and manage the records and let the patient check their test results.
