As a softcode team, we started working on a new project called NDB with Balla Group client.
NDB is a payment solution for Iraqi businesses, giving them the ability to accept payments from their customers.
Its aims to provide a secure and reliable payment solution for the region.

The project is a startup and I was the lead developer and project manager.
Its a full stack project, from the mobile application to the backend and admin panel.
Let's explore the different parts of the project.

### Mobile application
The mobile application is developed by React Native, and it's available for both iOS and Android.

### API Development
Our backend is designed with a focus on data management and monitoring. We've established a logical layer over the static schema and types, making it dynamic and adaptable for future changes. This layer utilizes JavaScript objects and generator functions to define the schema and types, simplifying updates and maintenance.

Each object has a set of properties that dictate and control the behavior of the fields and queries. We've also implemented multiple middleware for the APIs to handle various tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and more.

For instance, to designate a field as required, we simply add a required: true property to the field object. Similarly, to set a middleware for a query, we just need to add a middleware: [authMiddleware] property to the query object.


### Development and Deployment
For the development and deployment, we leverage the power of github and github actions.
Using different environments for the development, and production, we can easily test and deploy the changes to the different environments.


### Testing
For the testing, we used jest and end to end testing strategy.
The end to end testing, help us to test the whole system, from the mobile application to the backend and admin panel.

### Multiple payment providers
The project supports multiple payment providers, like FIB, ZainCash, and more.
The feature implementation was a bit challenging, in term of the different APIs and documentations.
We created a unified API for the payment providers, which make it easy to add new providers in the future.
