As a softcode team, we started working on a new project called NDB with Balla Group client.
NDB is a payment solution for Iraqi businesses, giving them the ability to accept payments from their customers.
Its aims to provide a secure and reliable payment solution for the region.

The project is a startup and I was the lead developer and project manager.
Its a full stack project, from the mobile application to the backend and admin panel.
Let's explore the different parts of the project.

### Mobile application
The mobile application is developed by React Native, and it's available for both iOS and Android.

### Graphql API
The backend is developed by Graphql, and it's a powerful tool for data management and monitoring.
We created a logical layer over the static graphql schema and types, and made it dynamic and flexible for the future changes.
The layer use js objects and generator functions to define the schema and types, which make it easy to update and maintain.

Each object has a set of properties, which define and controle the behavior of the fields and queries.
We also, created multiple middleware for the APIs, to handle different tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, and so on.

For example, to define a field as a required field, we just need to add a `required: true` property to the field object.
Or it set a middleware for a query, we just need to add a `middleware: [authMiddleware]` property to the query object.


### Development and Deployment
For the development and deployment, we leverage the power of github and github actions.
Using different environments for the development, and production, we can easily test and deploy the changes to the different environments.


### Testing
For the testing, we used jest and end to end testing strategy.
The end to end testing, help us to test the whole system, from the mobile application to the backend and admin panel.

### Multiple payment providers
The project supports multiple payment providers, like FIB, ZainCash, and more.
The feature implementation was a bit challenging, in term of the different APIs and documentations.
We created a unified API for the payment providers, which make it easy to add new providers in the future.
