 Hello :)
 My name is Fakhruddin Abdi.
 <br/>
 `I consider myself as a full stack developer but i used to manage projects as CEO or CTO`.
 <p> This is my story: </p>

<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Back to 2000 </h1>
My first exprience with computer goes back to DOS operation system.
<br/>But I didn't do coding/hacking or something special. 
Just enjoying gaming or playing with photo and video editors softwares With new microsoft OS - Windows series
<br/>


<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> University time at 2008 </h1>
As a software engineer students i started university.
<br/>In the university i spend my times on three different fields
1. Of course coding by C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP.
2. Network
3. AI

I started coding by `C and C++`.
<br/> I was really impressed with concept of `OOP` and how it turn your code into a living character. 

I had a comperssion idea which was exactly same as `pied piper` in [silicon valley series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).

<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/piedpiper.jpg" target="_blank">
	<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/piedpiper.jpg" />
</a>
<br/>I presented it and this is the reference in our [blog here](http://computer-08.blogfa.com/post/184)
<br/>The compression algorithm was Loss-Less and i used [Huffman algorithm ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) in byte level of the files.
<br/>I even wrote ุง working app using C++, but sometimes it made the file bigger :)

My favorite operation system was `Ubuntu` for a quite some time.
<br/>Now Im coding and working on macOS.

Alongside coding in the university i loved `Network` sceinse as well. 
<br>I enjoyed testing and simulating network using [cisco packet tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) . it helped me understand the network protocols and how they are communicating with each other. 
My final project was monitoring the network for a specifc packages using [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

Also i was really impressed by `Artificial intelligence` sceinse. I wrote a Matlab application which tried a model to find name of flowers.


In the last two years of my university season, `i focused on website development`.
I even had a course for the new students, teaching them web development.
My early projects were made with html and `HTML, jquery and bootstrap`.
But soon i switched to `HTML5, javascript and CSS/SCSS`

<br/>
While coding frontend, i traied backend with PHP and i came across its different frameworks and it was the first time i learned how we can build layers around pure languages and make it better.
<br/>
I tried `symfony, cake and Larvel and after many researches choosed Laravel.`
Laravel helped me learning code structure and MVC design framework.
Decoupling system into three different parts was very interesting for me.

<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> After univeristy 2012  </h1>
After university i immediately started my first job which was in a constructon company in sanandaj, as a developer, working on a C# project.
<br/>So i spent a short time on `Microsoft languages like C# and WPF using MVVM architecture` ( less than a year).

<p>Like many others, i quickly started to hate microsof technologies.</p>

Soon i found myself as a fan of frontend development.
And  `i have started coding in new Javascript frameworks like Angualr and now ReactJS` . Learning from FreeCodeCamp, Udacity and Mozila.
I started with `Agnuglar 1`. I was already familar with its MVC design framework. but i didn't feel comorable with the framework really.


`Then i came across React at 2014`, Just one year after open sourcing it in 2013.
<br/>`I slowly started to like functional programming`. No need to spent much time to shape your object. Just define your pure function and go ahead :D.
<br/>I browsed open source repositories and started rebuilding them. If I ever got stuck at something I would simply state my problem on the forums like SOF or the repository itself.

<p> Now i believe javascript is the most fast growing language and ReactJS framework with its Redux/Flux/Mobx/Recoil plugins is a revolution in the programming world.
So i will continue coding with javascript :). </p>

<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> As a co-founder at 2013 </h1>
At 2013, i joined a project as a developer, but after one year i continued as a co-founder and CTO and we got a good investment. 
<br/>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> And we moved to Erbil and started from scratch </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/office-early.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/office-early.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>
I built a technical team and managed all the strategies from tech stack to the releases and plans.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> At the benining we were few </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/team-early.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/team-early.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> But soon we started to grow and got more team members </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/team-after.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/team-after.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

I worked with a lot of great companies as a third-party, for example [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/) which helped us to load the freebase data on their graph database.
And yes, it was a great exprience.


We build the first version and presented to the stack holders.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<a href="/assets/images/about/presentation-zeyton-3.jpg" width="100" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 80%" src="/assets/images/about/presentation-zeyton-3.jpg" />

		<img  style="width: 80%" src="/assets/images/about/presentation-zeyton.jpg"/>
	</a>
</div>



But right before lunching and when we were close to the first release, the management board dedcided to handover the project to someone else and later the project died.


<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Left Zeyton, start Softcode at 2016 </h1>
After Zeyton I and Dr Layik (Our project manager in Zeyton) founded [Softcode](https://softcode.co.uk/) and started working on our own projects.


The first project was a social platofrm like instagram but focusing on topics instead of friendship.
<br/>We named it [Fotomantic](https://fotomantic-33bb7.web.app) ( but we loved photograph domain which was taken before)

We created the MVP version using firebase and Zeyton graph datrabase.The result was great.
But soon we found out its almost impossible to run it with our own budget.

So we decided to temporary switch to another project and we agreed to work on [Hotorder](https://hotorder.co.uk/).
<br/>
Hotorder is a food delivery platform, supporting multi shop, white label feature and no record history.
The target was UK market.
We used Meteor and ReactJS to code the project and after two months, we released the first version.
We even linked it with several resturants, but unfortunately due to financial problems we couldn't wait more.
So stopped all the projects and started accepting client projects under softcode branding.


<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Start Harzaan at 2017 </h1>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> But i didn't give up :), i founded another project -
		<a href="/harzaan" target="_blank">
			Harzaan
		</a>
		<br/>Harzaan is a classified ads service for Iraq market.
  </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> I build a team in Iran and started Harzaan as a classified ads service for Iraqi users. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/office-sna-old.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna-old.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

We build the first version and released it at 2017. It was very promising, many people started sending their posts on Harzaan and we passed 5K downloads in the first month.
We grew up and hits 50K downloads in the next 6 months and the number of daily posts riched about 200 per days.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> We applied for Science and Technology Park Of Kurdistan and they do support us by an office and mentorship. </p>
	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/office-sna.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

Then i started searching for an investment to do advertisements and build a full time team.

After negotiating with multiple companies, finally we agreed with [Box Advertisement](https://boxads.co) and i started a new journey in Iraq.

The first two years i worked in Iran office and managed the teams there.
But later i  moved to Erbil to analyse the market.
In the mean time i worked with [Knowledge University](https://knu.edu.iq) as IT Manager.

And Covid started...
I had to come back to Iran butr after sex months, again i moved to Sulaymaniyah and stayed there until now as a CEO/CTO of Harzaan
And its about 4 years i have full focus on Harzaan to make market leader in Iraq, Insha'allah.

That's it.My professional journey so far.
