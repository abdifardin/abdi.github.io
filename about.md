Greetings! My name is **Fakhruddin Abdi**.
<br/>
I consider myself as a full stack developer with prior experience managing projects as a CEO and CTO.

<p> Allow me to share my journey with you. </p>
<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Year 2000: The Beginning </h1>
In the year 2000, my tryst with computers began,
<br/>At first, it was more about gaming and exploring new photo and video editing tools bundled with the latest Microsoft Windows series, rather than coding.

<br/>
<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> University Journey - 2008 </h1>

Entering university as a software engineering student marked a new chapter in my life.I found myself engrossed in three distinct disciplines:
1. Programming languages including C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.
2. Networking.
3. Artificial Intelligence (AI).

My coding journey started with **C and C++**, where I was fascinated by the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and how it imbued codes with a lifelike persona. 

I conceived a compression idea remarkably similar to **Pied Piper** from the [Silicon Valley series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).

<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/piedpiper.jpg" target="_blank">
	<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/piedpiper.jpg" />
</a>
<br/>I publicly presented it, and posted on our [blog](http://computer-08.blogfa.com/post/184).
<br/>The compression algorithm was lossless, employing the [Huffman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) at the byte level of files. I even developed a working application using C++, although occasionally, it paradoxically enlarged the files. :)

During my time at the university, I also developed a keen interest in **Network** science. 
<br>I relished testing and simulating networks using [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer), which deepened my understanding of network protocols and their interactions.
My final project revolved around network packet monitoring using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

My fascination also extended to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I developed a Matlab application that trained a model to recognize flower names.

During the last two years of my university tenure, I shifted my focus towards **web development**.
I even conducted a course for new students, imparting web development skills.
My early projects were built with HTML, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
However, I soon transitioned to **HTML5, Javascript, and CSS/SCSS**.

While I was exploring front-end development, I also ventured into the back-end realm with PHP. This was my first encounter with language frameworks that could enhance pure languages.
<br/>
After experimenting with **Symfony, Cake, and Laravel**, I ultimately chose Laravel for its user-friendly code structure and MVC design framework.
The concept of system decoupling into three distinct parts was a revelation to me.

<br/>
<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Post University - 2012 </h1>
Upon graduation, I swiftly transitioned into my first job at a construction company in Sanandaj. As a developer, I worked on a C# project.
<br/>This allowed me a brief exposure to Microsoft languages like **C#** and **WPF** using the **MVVM architecture** (less than a year).

<p>However, like many developers, I found Microsoft technologies somewhat restrictive.</p>

Soon, I discovered a passion for front-end development.
And thus, I embarked on a journey with new JavaScript frameworks like **Angular**, and later, **ReactJS**, learning from resources like FreeCodeCamp, Udacity, and Mozilla.
I initially started with **Angular 1**. Its MVC design framework was familiar territory, but I couldn't resonate fully with the framework.

Then, in 2014, I encountered React, just a year after it was open-sourced.
<br/>**Functional programming** began to appeal to me. The lack of the need to meticulously structure your objects, the simplicity of defining **pure functions**, and moving forward was an appealing concept.

<br/>
<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Zeyton - 2013 </h1>
In 2013, I joined the [Zeyton](/zeyton) project as a developer and quickly transitioned to co-founder and CTO. Our venture secured significant investment.<br/>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> We relocated to Erbil, where we started from ground zero. </p>

	</a>
</div>
I took the reins of building a technical team and charted out the strategies from tech stack selection to release schedules and plans.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> In the beginning, our team was a compact unit. </p>

</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
	<p style="width: 50%"> However, it didn't take long for us to expand and welcome more members into our growing team. </p>

</div>

I had the privilege of working with numerous remarkable companies as a third-party, including [Blazegraph](https://blazegraph.com/), who assisted us in loading freebase data onto their graph database.
Undoubtedly, it was an enriching experience.

We successfully built the first version and showcased it to our stakeholders.

However, just when we were on the cusp of launching and close to the first release, the management board decided to transition the project to different hands, which unfortunately led to its eventual discontinuation.

<br/>
<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Softcode - 2016 </h1>
Post Zeyton, Dr Layik (our project manager at Zeyton) and I co-founded [Softcode](https://softcode.co.uk/), enabling us to focus on developing our own projects.

Our maiden project was a social platform akin to Instagram, with the unique spin of emphasizing topics over friendship networks.
<br/>We christened it [Fotomantic](/Fotomantic) (although we had a soft spot for the domain "photograph", which was unfortunately taken already).

We developed an MVP using Firebase and Zeyton's graph database. The outcome was encouraging.
However, we soon realized the challenge of sustaining the project within our financial means.

Subsequently, we pivoted to another project, settling on [Hotorder](/Hotorder).
<br/>
Hotorder is a multi-shop, white-label food delivery platform that doesn't record history. Our target audience was the UK market.
We utilized Meteor and ReactJS to develop the project, and within two months, we rolled out the first version.
We managed to integrate it with several restaurants, but due to financial constraints, we were unable to sustain the projects.
Hence, we transitioned to client projects under the Softcode brand.

<h1 style="text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Harzaan - The New Beginnings in 2017 </h1>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> I didn't give up with startups, I ventured into a new project -
		<a href="/harzaan" target="_blank">
			Harzaan

		<br/>Harzaan is a platform for classified ads for Iraq market.

	<a style="width: 50%"  href="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/harzaan-first.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> I assembled a team in Iran and launched Harzaan as a classified ads service for the users in Iraq. </p>

		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna-old.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

We built and released the first version in 2017. The response was overwhelming, with numerous people posting their ads on Harzaan. In the first month alone, we saw over 5K downloads. This rapid growth persisted, and we hit 50K downloads in the next six months. Daily ad postings reached about 200 per day.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 50%"> Our application to the Science and Technology Park Of Kurdistan was accepted and they supported us with office space and mentorship. </p>

		<img style="width: 90%" src="/assets/images/about/office-sna.jpg" />
	</a>
</div>

At this stage, I started seeking investors to finance our advertising efforts and expand our full-time team.

After negotiations with several potential partners, we reached an agreement with [Box Advertisement](https://boxads.co).

For the initial two years, I worked out of our Iran office, managing the teams. Later, I relocated to Erbil to gain a deeper understanding of the market.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic...

I had to return to Iran, but six months later, I moved back to Sulaymaniyah, where I currently reside, serving as the CEO/CTO of Harzaan. For the past four years, my entire focus has been on establishing Harzaan as a market leader in Iraq, Insha'allah.

That's a good start! Here's how you could enhance the section:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 10px">
	<p style="width: 60%"> 
		While driving Harzaan's growth, I also envisioned and realized the creation of a dedicated software development arm within our partner company, Box Advertising. Thus, Box Development was born.

And that sums up my professional journey thus far.
